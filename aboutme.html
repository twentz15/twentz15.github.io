	I know basic HTML coding from a High School class I took in my Junior year of High school. Remembering the basics hit me when we went over Chapter 2 and I started to remember how much fun it was. HTML is a more forgiving language because it isn't as case sensitive as Java. However I know very little about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). From what I have seen from pictures in the text book they look more like a Java like code except in HTML language.

	I would like to learn how to properly set up a website and maintain its appearance. From this class I want to be able to understand the basics for starting a website and be able to set up the proper server mechanics for it to work properly. My end goal for the class is be able to put my own website up for personal use and create a professional appearance for myself to possible employers.
